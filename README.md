# USA Flights Data Analysis
This course project employs MySQL Server to store, manage, and analyze data related to the U.S. airline industry for 2015. MySQL Server's relational database capabilities were used to create and maintain structured tables containing flight data. SQL queries were written to extract and aggregate key metrics, such as the frequency of flight delays, reasons for cancellations, and departure frequencies from various airports. The database also facilitated calculations for average and maximum airtime of flights and allowed for detailed analysis of cancellation reasons.
